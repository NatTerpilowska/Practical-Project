# Practical-Project

For my project I have decided to create a D&D app that generates a random character (class and race) and automatically gives the base points based on the two.

The requirements of my project, set by QA Academy are as follows:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
