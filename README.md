# Practical-Project

For my project I have decided to create a D&D app that generates a random character (class and race) and automatically gives the base points based on the two.

The requirements of my project, set by QA Academy are as follows:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.

# Proposal
I've decided to develop a simple D&D Character Generator application which generates character's race, class and ability points. I will explain how I structured my services below:
* Service 1 is a front end application that gathers the information generated by the other services.
* Service 2 generates a character's race using the random python module from a given list.
* Service 3 generaters a character's class using the same method as the application above.
* Service 4 gathers the information given by Service 2 and 3 and generates ability points based on Service 2 and 3 using a dictionary and requests.

## Architecture
# Risk Assessment
The risk assessment below highlights the potential risks that would prevent me from completing the project. I find it extremely important to have a plan when dealing with difficult situations and luckily - none of the risks were something I've been dealing with by the end of the project. I always like to think about the technical risks as well as enviromental ones.

# Planning Board (Trello)
Can be seen here: https://trello.com/b/A7OrSxv2/project2
I've chosen Trello because it's very quick and easy to use.

# Testing
I've managed to achieve 98% coverage using pytest for unit testing and all of my tests were ran by Jenkins.
The test in Service 1 is a mock test that inputs variables that would have been generated by service 2, 3 and 4 together.
The rest tests whether correct things have been generated and the status codes of the server.

## Infrastructure

* Jenkins
I've used Jenkins to automate my deployment and therefore reduce the time it takes from development to actually deploying the application. Whenever a push is made to my Dev branch on github, Jenkins runs the whole job for me and quickly updates the page of my application using a webhook.

The Jenkins pipeline is as follows:
* Installing Dependencies.
* Tests using Pytest together with detailed logs.
* Build images using Docker-compose while handing the DockerHub credentials.
* VM configuration - Ansible - Setting up the swarm by generating the join tokens on manager VM for the worker VM, and also setting up my NGINX as the load balancer.
* Deployment using docker-compose.yaml

# Database
I've used a simple model of a single table database and described the exact structure of it in the diagram below:
